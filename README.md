## Introduction
For our final project, we train a model to classify real person face and fake person face. We train two neural network models, 
first one with 4 Convolution layers and for the other we transfer learning using densenet. We evaluate and compare both models.
Then create a demo app with the better one.

This repository designed in a way that anyone can recreate what we did. 
You can use it to create your own image classifier.

## About The Dataset
You can find the dataset here https://www.kaggle.com/xhlulu/140k-real-and-fake-faces.

This dataset consists of all 70k REAL faces from the Flickr dataset collected by Nvidia, as well as 70k fake faces sampled from the 1 Million FAKE faces (generated by StyleGAN) that was provided by Bojan.

All images has a size of 256px split into train, validation, and test set. each set also split into each images labels(real and fake)

## Workflow
1. Preparing the dataset
2. Train models
3. Compare and evaluate
4. Deploy
